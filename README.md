1. Visualizing and checking the smoothness prior : Given an image I,  consider all valid pairs of neighboring pixels, compute the difference between their intensity or color values, and plot the histogram. 
2. Finding the shortest path : Consider the image segment shown.

Let V={0,1} and compute the lengths of the shortest 4-, 8-, and m-path between p and q. Show the corresponding paths. If a particular path does not exist between these two points, explain why. 
Repeat for V={1,2}.
Write python / matlab code to implement the function.
